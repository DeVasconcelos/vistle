Vistle Data Structures
**********************

Grid Types
==========
- explain how to define the different grid types (uniform, rectilinear, curvilinear, unstructured)

Data fields
===========
- could also add class diagram to explain how we added vtk-m support (but might make more sense in the guide on how to write GPU modules)
